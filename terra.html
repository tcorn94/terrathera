<h3>Meet Your Therapist</h3>
<p><I'm Taylor and I've been practicing as a licensed massage therapist for 2.5 years in a spa, and now I'm deciding to experiment with accepting private clients.

    My set up is very basic, but my fees are basic, too.
    
    I offer Swedish style, deep tissue, cupping, myofascial technique, or gua sha (Graston, scraping). No additional charge for these modalities.
    
    I also offer aroma therapy, or use of topicals of your choice such as Biofreeze, Prossage, arnica, Tiger Balm, etc.
    
    *****I do not use hot stones and I do not do stretching. My table cannot accommodate anyone weighing more than 300lbs or anyone taller than 6 feet, unless you don't mind your feet hanging off the end.
